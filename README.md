# AND Gate on Basys-3
This repository contains the implementation of a simple 2-input AND gate using Verilog, targeted for the Basys 3 FPGA development board. The project is developed and simulated in Vivado, and the design is tested on the board using its onboard switches and LEDs.

Features
Implements a basic 2-input AND gate logic.
Uses the Basys 3 board's switches as inputs and LEDs as outputs.
Provides a simple example for beginners learning Verilog and FPGA design.
